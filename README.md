### Pros and Cons of TDD
**Pros**  
The advantage of TDD is that it provides high test coverage and reliable code because tests are written before the implementation process. These tests corresponding to the code also help developers to debug the code easier because developers can run the tests to see which function failed. Since the property of TDD is to write tests before writing the codes, the developers can write just enough codes that allows the codes to pass. With TDD, codes are also easier to maintain and refactor because the test codes provide clarity during the implementation process. Bugs introduced when implementing new features are also easier to catch because developers can run the test codes after implementing new features to see if they accidentally introduce a bug or not.

**Cons**  
The disadvantage of TDD is that it's hard to maintain and learn. Whenever the requirements of the function changes, the tests should also be updated to make the tests more reliable. Furthermore, writing the tests is very time-consuming and the tests may be hard to write because it's some scenarios are hard to mock up. Since the process to write the tests is very time-consuming, it may also slow down the development process in short term.
